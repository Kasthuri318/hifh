     <dl>
        <b><dt>Algorithm:</dt></b>
          <dd>A step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.</dd>
        <b><dt>Data Structure:</dt></b>
          <dd>A way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently.</dd>
        <b><dt>Programming Language:</dt></b>
          <dd>A formal system of instructions for a computer, comprising syntax and semantics, used to produce software or perform specific tasks.</dd>
        <b><dt>Variable:</dt></b>
          <dd>A storage location with an associated symbolic name (an identifier) that contains some known or unknown quantity of information, known as a value.</dd>
        <b><dt>Function:</dt></b>
          <dd>A self-contained unit of code that performs a specific task. Functions are often used to break down a program into modular and manageable pieces.</dd>
        <b><dt>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</dt></b>
          <dd>A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.</dd>
        <b><dt>Algorithmic Complexity:</dt></b>
          <dd>The measure of the amount of computational resources, such as time and space, that an algorithm consumes to complete its task.</dd>
        <b><dt>Database:</dt></b>
          <dd>An organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently.</dd>
        <b><dt>Operating System:</dt></b>
          <dd>Software that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.</dd>
        <b><dt>Network:</dt></b>
          <dd>A collection of computers and other devices interconnected by communication channels that allow them to share resources and information.</dd>
        <b><dt>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</dt></b>
          <dd> The simulation of human intelligence in machines, typically through the development of algorithms that enable computers to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence.</dd>
        <b><dt>Encryption:</dt></b>
          <dd>The process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It is widely used to secure data transmission and storage.</dd>
        <b><dt>Debugging:</dt></b>
          <dd>The process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in computer programs.</dd>
        <b><dt>Compiler:</dt></b>
          <dd>A program that translates source code written in a programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer.</dd>
        <b><dt>API (Application Programming Interface):</dt></b>
          <dd>A set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.</dd>
