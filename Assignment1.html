     <h2 >Introduction :</h2>
         <p > Oxygen is a <mark><em> chemical element </em></mark>; it has symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds.</p>
     <h2 >History Of Study: </h2>
         <p >One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the <em>2nd century BCE</em> <del>France</del> <ins>Greek</ins> writer on mechanics, <mark><em>Philo of Byzantium</em></mark>.</p>
     <h2 >Biological production and role of O<sub>2</sub> :</h2>
         <h3  >>Photosynthesis and Respiration:</h3>
            <p align="center">In nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants<sup>[74]</sup> Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year<sup>[75] </sup></p>
         <h3> >A simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is<sup>[76]</sup>:</h3>
            <p align="center" ><mark>6 CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>o + <em>photons</em> = c<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub></mark></p>
     <h2 >Applications :</h2>
         <h3 >>Life support & Recreational Use : </h3>
            <p>An application of O
               <sub>2</sub> as a low-pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits, which surround their occupant's body with the breathing gas. These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure, resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>
             This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility.<sup>[114][115]</sup></p>

Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction <mark><em>(about 23.3 kJ/mol per hydrogen atom)</em> </mark> an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule.</p>
